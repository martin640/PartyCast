# PartyCast

PartyCast is collaborative music player based on ExoPlayer2 and communication between devices is done through WebSockets. Music is queued in rounds where each lobby member can enqueue only single song.

App contains default ExoPlayer2/WS implementation enabling server to be run on Android device, however PartyCast core can be implemented on standalone embedded device with custom rules and behavior.
